# 💹 Financial Sentiment Analysis using FinBERT

This project performs sentiment analysis on financial text data using the FinBERT model. It helps classify financial news, reports, or headlines into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments to assist in understanding market sentiment trends.

## 📌 Objective

To explore sentiment dynamics in financial narratives using a pretrained transformer-based model, enabling better investment decision-making and news-based market analysis.

## 🧠 What is FinBERT?

FinBERT is a variant of BERT fine-tuned specifically for financial sentiment classification. It is trained on financial communication texts and outperforms general-purpose sentiment models in this domain.


## ⚙️ Features

- Load financial text data (e.g., news headlines)
- Preprocess the data for input into FinBERT
- Classify sentiment: Positive / Negative / Neutral
- Visualize sentiment distribution
- Supports batch analysis for large text corpora

## 🚀 How to Run
